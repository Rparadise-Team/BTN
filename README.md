Hello everyone:

This image <strong>DOES NOT</strong> include games or the BIOS files, so you need to add this and the ROMs with their corresponding scrapes. It is designed to use the same ROM packs from BOM (Brothers of Metal), but you can add whichever ROMs you like.

If you are not using the BOM packs, please note that the scrapes should be placed in a folder named "Imgs" inside each system folder within the "ROMS" directory (Roms/Imgs). The scrape should have the same name as the ROM and be in "png" format.

It is recommended that scrapes have a maximum resolution of 320x240 to avoid performance issues.

<strong><u>CLEAN INSTALLATION</u></strong>

Copy the contents of the <code class="monospace-text">"Better Than Nothing (BTN) beta version 1.7z"</code> file (essentially, unzip everything) onto a Micro-SD card formatted to FAT32 with a 32 allocation size.
Once everything is unzipped, insert the card into the console and turn it on. It will start with a screen indicating that it is preparing the first boot (creating the cache file), then a screen with the image name will appear, followed by the system's main menu. After this, you need to turn off the console, add the games to the card, and you're set.
<strong><u>INSTALLATION FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION</u></strong>

If you have saved games, back up the "saves" and "states" folders located in the "\Retroarch.retroarch" directory on the Micro-SD card.
Delete all contents of the Micro-SD card except for the "Roms" folder to keep the same games.
Copy the contents of the <code class="monospace-text">"Better Than Nothing (BTN) beta version 1.7z"</code> file (essentially, unzip everything).
Restore the backup of the saved games.
Insert the card into the console and turn it on.
It will start with a screen indicating that it is preparing the first boot (creating the cache file), then a screen with the image name will appear, followed by the system's main menu.
