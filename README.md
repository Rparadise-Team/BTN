Hello everyone:

This image does NOT have games or bios.
Please note that the scrapes should be placed in a folder named "Imgs" inside each system folder within the "ROMS" directory (Roms/Imgs). The scrape should have the same name as the ROM and be in "png" format.
It is recommended that scrapes have a maximum resolution of 320x240 to avoid performance issues.

<strong><u> HOW TO INSTALL</u></strong>

- Copy the contents of the "Better Than Nothing (BTN) beta version 1" file to a Micro-SD card formatted in FAT32 with allocation size 32.
- Put the card in the console and turn it on. It will boot with a screen indicating that it is preparing the first boot (creates the cache memory file), then a screen with the name of the image and then it will jump to the main system menu. Once this is done, you have to turn off the console, then transfer the games to the card and that's it.
